## Some useful VBA Macros for SolidWorks
In this repository I am collecting some useful macros I've developed to make my life esear as a Mechanical Designer using SolidWorks everyday.

## Macros
- [Open In Ultimaker Cura](OpenInCura.txt). This macro allows you to automatically save any model in .STL format and open it in Ultimaker Cura.

## How to use this macros
1. In SolidWorks, go to Tools > Macros > New.
2. Save the .swp file in any folder you want with a descriptive name.
3. Remove all the text that appears by default and copy and paste all code of the macro you want to use.
4. Save the file and close the VBA editor.
5. You can now run the macro by going to Tools > Macros > Run, and selecting the macro wherever you save it.
